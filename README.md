# Analysis of musical patterns

We collected music listening data from the Spotify platform which provided us with a listening history file.
This history file contains informations on the listening over a period from 30/09/2021 to 24/11/2021, we can find the album followed by the artist, the day of the listening and the listening time
In addition, we queried the API to obtain more information about the artists and music in the listening history file

This additional information allows us to know some interesting factors such as the artist's musical genres, popularity, number of followers, album release date and number of tracks, etc.

This is very interesting data if one is interested in predicting musical trends by analysing the listener's habits and preferences
